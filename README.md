# Airfare Price Prediction


   

As domestic air travel is getting more and more popular
these days in India with various air ticket booking channels
coming up online, travelers are trying to understand how
these airline companies make decisions regarding ticket
prices over time. Unfortunately this dynamic pricing
strategy is usually carried out programmatically and is
based on certain hidden parameters (e.g. number of days
left till flight departure, or number of seats left). The project
works on mining the previous airfare data and developing
data modeling technique to predict the price variation over
time so that the consumer could benefit from it. This
project documents a study conducted to understand the
airfare dependency over many hidden variables of which
oil price, week day of departure, number of stops still have
not received much attention from the research community,
it also describes the two different methodologies adopted
to model this price change, comparative analysis of
algorithms under these two methodologies, applied on real
world data has also been performed. The comparative
analysis thus helped us to find out the most effective
algorithm for the prediction of the airfare variations. The
study suggests that mining historical airfare data and
modeling using machine learning algorithms can help
predict price trend and save consumers substantial sum of
money


Almost all airline companies base their ticket price on demand
estimation models and implement various dynamic pricing
strategies in order to regulate seats demand and maximize their
revenue. These corporations are said to use some proprietary
software to evaluate ticket price per seat on a given day for a
particular flight but the algorithms used are guarded with
commercial secrets. These companies usually tie up with various
online ticket sale channels (yatra.com, makemytrip.com,
paytm.com) which maintains real time data on ticket price and
constantly updates this price per seat over time. These channels
are usually available over the internet where the traveler can
book the ticket conveniently paying some convenience charges.
This constant updating of prices results in high fluctuation
which often confuses consumers as to when book their flight
tickets to get best of the deals. This project focuses on reducing
that fluctuation and giving the fare prices
